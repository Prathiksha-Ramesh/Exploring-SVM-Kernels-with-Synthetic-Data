# Project Title: Exploring SVM Kernels with Synthetic Data

## Overview

This project explores the application of different Support Vector Machine (SVM) kernels on a synthetic dataset. The goal is to understand how various kernels affect the performance of SVM classifiers and how to visualize and interpret the decision boundaries created by these kernels.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required packages using the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The required packages are listed in the requirements.txt file:

- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- pandas

## Usage
1. Data Preparation: The notebook generates a synthetic dataset for classification tasks.

2. Running the Notebook: Open the notebook.ipynb file to follow the step-by-step process.

## Steps in the Notebook:
1.Import Libraries:

Import necessary libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn`.

2. Create Synthetic Dataset:

Generate a synthetic dataset using numpy for creating circular data points.
Create a DataFrame from the synthetic data and label the classes.

3. Visualize Data:

Use matplotlib to visualize the synthetic dataset.

4. Prepare Data for SVM:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`.
Create additional features to capture the components of the kernels.

5. Train SVM Classifier:

Train an SVM classifier with different kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF).
Visualize the decision boundaries created by different kernels.

6. Evaluate Model:

Evaluate the performance of each SVM classifier using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
